# Overview

This project is for learning about and experimenting with
[Brunch](http://brunch.io), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and
related technologies.  It is based on the [AngularJS phone catalog
tutorial](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git), which we
will refer to as *angular-phonecat*.

## Installation

Please refer to the instructions in the [top level
README](https://github.com/jmafc/angular-phonecat-brunch/blob/master/README.md).

## Why Brunch?

Brunch was chosen over [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) (preferred by the
AngularJS team) because of the former's simplicity and speed (and
because we agree with Alex Gaynor that [you shouldn't have
auto-generated
files](https://speakerdeck.com/alex/take-2-if-i-got-to-do-django-all-over-again?slide=30)).

## Directory Layout

*Angular-phonecat* is based in part on
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) and uses the
following layout:

 ```
  app/                 # files to be used in production
    css/               # CSS files
      app.css          # default stylesheet
      bootstrap.css    # Twitter Bootstrap stylesheet
    img/               # image files
      glyphicons*.png  # Twitter Bootstrap icons
      phones/          # JPEG phone images
    index.html         # main HTML template file
    js/                # JavaScript files
      app.js           # application

      runner.html      # end-to-end test runner
      scenarios.js     # end-to-end specs
    lib/               # testing support libraries

        angular-*.js   # mock and scenario (end-to-end) support
    unit/              # unit level specs/tests
      *Spec.js         # specs for controllers, directives, etc.
```

On the other hand, this project --following Brunch and to some extent
[angular-brunch-seed](https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed)--
uses the following layout (some sections to be expanded later):

```
  app/                    # application source files
    app.coffee            # main application script
    assets/               # static files (copied as-is to `public`)
    index.jade            # main Jade template file
    partials/             # partial Jade templates
      *.jade
    scripts/              # application scripts
      controllers.coffee  # application controllers
      ...
    styles/               # application stylesheets
      app.styl            # default stylesheet
  bower_components/       # downloaded Bower components
    angular/
      angular.js          # AngularJS specified in bower.json
    ...
  bower.json              # Bower components spec
  config.coffee           # Brunch config file
  node_modules/           # Node.js modules, specified in package.json
  package.json            # Node.js (npm) package spec
  public/                 # files to be served
    css/
      app.css             # concatenation of app and vendor stylesheets
    index.html            # main HTML file
    js/
      app.js              # concatenation of app JavaScript files
      vendor.js           # concatenation of vendor JavaScript files
  test/                   # test specs and config files
    e2e/                  # scenario (end-to-end) tests
      scenarios.coffee    # specs for scenario tests
    karma.conf.js         # config file for unit tests
    karma-e2e.conf.js     # config file for end-to-end tests
    karma-shared.conf.js  # shared configuration items
    unit/                 # unit test specs
      *Spec.coffee        # specs for controllers, directives, etc.
  vendor/                 # 3rd party libraries
    styles/
```

It should be emphasized that Brunch allows you to tailor this layout
to suit your preferences.  For example, you can edit `config.coffee`
to rename the `public` directory or to specify how should files be
compiled or concatenated.

## Serving the Application

*Angular-phonecat* provides a basic Node.js web server (in
`scripts/web-server.js`) and if you run it from the `app` directory,
you can access the application at
http://localhost:8000/app/index.html.  However, you can use any
other server.

Brunch provides its own development server.  You can start it from the
command line with:

 `brunch watch --server`

which can be shortened to `brunch w -s`. However, we suggest you use

 `npm start`

Brunch will watch the files in the project and re-compile whenever
necessary.  In addition, `auto-reload-brunch` will react to changes on
the web browser side.

# Tutorial Outline

Please refer to the [Angular-phonecat
README](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/blob/master/README.md)
and the [AngularJS Tutorial](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index)
for details on the steps from the basic AngularJS viewpoint.  In what
follows, we highlight the differences between *angular-phonecat* and
this project.

If you follow along by checking out each step, please remember that
when packages or components are added to `package.json` or
`bower.json`, you will need to run `npm install` or `bower install`,
respectively, in order to add the parts to your environment.

## Step-0 - Bootstrapping the App

At this stage, the simple `index.html` is almost identical to the one
from the parent project.  However, it is placed in `app/assets`
because it gets copied as-is to the `public` directory.  Note also
that the `angular.js` file, which you downloaded with Bower and then
copied to `vendor/scripts`, has been copied to `public/js/vendor.js`.
Similarly, the `bootstrap.css` which you put in `vendor/styles` was
copied to `public/css/app.css`.

You may want to experiment with `brunch build --optimize` to verify
that the latter two files in the `public` subdirectories have been
minified.

You can also verify that Brunch recompilation and browser reloading is
working by doing the experiment suggested in [this
step](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00) of the AngularJS
tutorial.  Ensure you read and follow the [Auto-Reload
section](https://github.com/jmafc/angular-phonecat-brunch#auto-reload)
in the main README.

## Step-0a - Use Jade Templates

In this step, we converted the `index.html` file to a
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) template.  `index.jade` gets compiled,
with the help of
[jade-angularjs-brunch](https://github.com/GulinSS/jade-angularjs-brunch),
and ends up as `public/index.html` just like the original.

## Step-1 - Static Item List

This step introduces some minor HTML and CSS changes:

 - `index.jade` got an unordered list of two phones (and a title change)
 - `app/styles/app.css` was added which only specified body padding.

Note that the latter CSS file gets concatenated at the end of
`bootstrap.css` to form `public/css/app.css`.

## Step-2 - Angular ngRepeat Directive

This is where an [AngularJS
controller](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.mvc.understanding_controller)
makes its first appearance, feeding static data to the application.
The HTML also becomes dynamic with the [ngRepeat
directive](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngRepeat).

## Unit Testing

Step-2 also incorporates unit testing.  This is done through the
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) test runner and the
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) behavior-driven
development (BDD) framework.  To support this, we added Karma as a
devDependency in `package.json` and changed the `scripts:test` command
to start Karma.

The original `karma.conf.js` was adapted by using the `angular.js` and
`angular-mock.js` files directly from the `bower_components`
subdirectory.  After some experimentation (on Debian), we also
specified 'Firefox' and 'Chrome' (or `chromium`) as browsers (now in
`karma-shared.conf.js`).  Please refer to [Karma
documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/config/browsers.html)
for more details on choices for your environment.  For example, on
Debian, in order to run Chromium as Chrome, you'll need to use
`CHROME_BIN`, i.e.,

 `export CHROME_BIN=/usr/bin/chromium`

The `test/unit/controllersSpec.js` unit test specification is
identical to the one in *angular-phonecat* (but see below).

To run the unit tests, invoke `npm test`.  Karma will be watching your
source files as well, so that changes you make will trigger a re-test.

## Step-2a - Use CoffeeScript

At this stage we replaced the JavaScript files
(`app/scripts/controllers.js` and `test/unit/controllersSpec.js`) by
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) counterparts.

## Step-3 - Interactive Search

In this step, a
[filter](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.filter:filter) is used to
allow the user to select a subset of records. This also demonstrates
data binding since the input box has the `ng-model` attribute with
value **query** and the latter is used as the `expression` parameter
to the filter.

Only `app/index.html` was changed in the original, so we only made
equivalent modifications to `app/index.jade`.

## Scenario Testing

Step-3 also introduces scenario testing (also referred to as
end-to-end testing in AngularJS documentation).  To support this, we
added the original `config/karma-e2e.conf.js` in the `test` directory
and adapted it by changing the file extensions, browsers and proxy
port, and adding a `urlRoot` specification.

We also adapted `test/e2e/scenarios.js` into an equivalent
Coffeescript file.

In order to run the tests, you first need to have the Brunch server
running (i.e., do `npm start` or `brunch w -s`).  Then, from another
shell invoke:

`karma start test/karma-e2e.conf.js`

This is set up to run as a single shot rather than watch over files.
*Angular-phonecat* also includes a `test/e2e/runner.html` which allows
running the scenario tests from an already open browser window.  This
could perhaps be adapted to run from the `public` directory (by
installing the original in `app/assets`, but we have chosen not to do
so for the time being.

## Step-4 - Ordering the List

This step adds a simple feature: a drop-down list to allow the user to
select the order in which the items are displayed.  An 'age' property
is added to the model to support both alphabetical and aged ordering.
An additional unit test and a couple of end-to-end tests are present
as well.

The changes to HTML and JavaScript in the original project were fairly
straightforward to convert to Jade and CoffeeScript.  Note that the
CoffeeScript files have been style-checked with
[CoffeeLint](http://www.coffeelint.org/), which resulted, for example,
in reformatting some long lines.

## Step-5 - XHR and Dependency Injection

At this stage, the hard-coded data in the controller is replaced by a
static `phones.json` file.  We placed it under `app/assets/phones` so
that Brunch will copy it into `public/phones`. The file is loaded
using the [$http service](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http),
which is passed into the `PhoneListCtrl` controller using [dependency
injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di).

This process is mocked in the unit tests by using the
[inject](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.mock.inject) function
to supply fixed data and by instantiating the controller before each
test.  The scenario test only required adjustment to the expected item
counts.

## Step-6 Add Images and Links

In this step, thumbnail images of the phones were added to the list.
We added the JPEGs in `app/img/phones/` to `app/assets/img/phones` so
they would get copied to `public/img/phones`.  `app/index.jade` was
modified to include IMG tags (and also links to future detail pages.
The `app.css` file was changed to size the thumbnails and to better
style the page.  Finally, a third end-to-end test was added to
`test/e2e/scenarios.coffee`.

## Step-6a - Use Stylus

Now that we have a not so trivial stylesheet, we can introduce a
dynamic stylesheet language processor.  I've chosen
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) and this step renames
(and modifies) `app/styles/app.css` to `app.styl` for this purpose.
The resulting file is not much different and doesn't take advantage of
more advanced features of Stylus.  You'll also need to install
`stylus-brunch` (which has been added to `package.json`.

## Step-7 - Routing and App Partitioning

This step adds `app/app.coffee` which uses the
[$routeProvider](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$routeProvider)
service to handle application routes.

On the HTML side, most of the body of `app/index.jade` was split and
placed in `partials/phone-list.jade`.  The former was replaced by a
`div` tag with an
[ng-view](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngView)
attribute.  A new file, `partials/phone-detail.jade`, is a stub for a
detail view.  A new controller, `PhoneDetailCtrl` was added to
`app/scripts/controllers.coffee`.

On the testing front, a unit test for the new controller was also
stubbed out, but `scenarios.coffee` now verifies that the `phoneId` is
passed down from the list to the detail stub.  In addition, an
end-to-end test was added to check that the root URL gets redirected
to `/phones`.

## Step-8 - Details View

In this step we fill out the stubs from the previous one.  To provide
detailed phone information, we copied JSON files and JPEG images from
the original project to the `app/assets/phones` and
`app/assets/img/phones` directories, respectively.

The `app/partials/phone-detail.jade` was fleshed out to display the
detailed information and images and the 'app/styles/app.styl`
stylesheet was updated to improve the esthetics.

The unit test stub for PhoneDetailCtrl was also changed to actually
verify proper fetching of (mocked) detail data.  Similarly, the phone
detail scenario test now checks the phone name (rather than
`phoneId`).

## Step-9 - Custom Filter

This step adds a custom filter to display Boolean values using Unicode
symbols.  The filter is defined in `app/scripts/filters.coffee` and
this module is injected into `app/app.coffee`.  The
`phone-detail.jade` template was changed to use the filter in a couple
of items.  A unit test to verify the filter was added with
`test/unit/filterSpec.coffee`.

## Step-10 - Event Handlers

A simple click event handler was added through an
[ng-click](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngClick)
attribute in the list of secondary images in the `phone-detail.jade`
partial. This invokes a `setImage` function that was coded as part of
the `PhoneDtailCtrl` controller.

To verify this, one unit test and two end-to-end tests were also
written.

## Step-11 - Custom Service

In this step of the original tutorial, the $http service introduced in
step-5 was replaced by a custom service using the
[$resource](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource)
factory.  This doesn't affect the application's external behavior in
any way, but makes it easier to program --since it is a higher-level
API-- or to modify, e.g., by replacing the backend.

To implement the factory we first had to add `angular-resource` to
`bower.json`.  The custom service was then defined in
`app/scripts/services.coffee` and injected into the application in
`app/app.coffee`.  The service replaced the $http calls in
`app/scripts/controllers.coffee`.

For testing, `test/karma.conf.js` was modified to generalize the
AngularJS files needed.  The `controllersSpec.coffee` was also
modified, as per the original tutorial.
